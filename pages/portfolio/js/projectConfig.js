            'Veggie Slam is a 2D side scrolling game, the goal is to traverse the levels in order to complete the given objective. Instead of fighting off enemies in this platformer, you must swan dive and body slam the ground to knock them away. The idea of the game is fun and has a couple different possiblities outside of just reaching a goal. One of which I was able to implement in the time span was bouncing an enemy into a goal across the map.',
